# Bwtmaw

Tools for computing minimal absent words (MAWs) and minimal rare words (MRWs) in small space. The tool allows computing several scores for M\*Ws, and to output just those with high score.

## References

The theory behind this code is described in the following paper:

* A modern, C++11 ready compiler such as [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org) version 4.9 or higher, or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org) version 3.2 or higher.
* A 64-bit operating system. The code was tested on both Mac OS X and Linux.

## Installing and testing

Compile the rest with `make`:

```
make tests
make optimized
```

The `tests` executable runs the test suite.




## Iterator and huge pages

Like most data structures built on the BWT, the iterator accesses the underlying index without any spatial or temporal locality. This means that most accesses induce a cache miss and, symmetrically, a TLB miss. The TLB is typically small and the BWT index is typically large: if one uses small memory pages, just a few page translation entries can fit in the TLB, and every query to the TLB is very likely a miss. Conversely, if one uses large memory pages, a large fraction of the page translation entries needed by the iterator can fit into the TLB, and misses become rare. If the TLB is implemented as part of one or more levels of CPU cache, fewer translation entries might also mean more cache space for data. Since the iterator is memory-bound, the time spent serving a TLB miss might be a significant fraction of the total runtime of the iterator. Large pages also increase the probability that the BWT index is allocated in large, contiguous memory areas, so if a block of the index straddles several pages it is more likely that these pages are physically adjacent, and that caching or prefetching by the processor might help.

Running the count-only variant of the one-string iterator with 2MB pages instead of the default 4KB pages gives **a speedup of approx. 15%** on a real 22GB DNA text (index size in RAM 6.5 GB) using 24 threads running on 24 physical cores. Using 1GB pages saves just 3.6% of the time spent with 2MB pages.

### Configuring huge pages

Please refer to more specialized documentation for details on huge pages (for example, the [libhugetlbfs HOWTO](https://github.com/libhugetlbfs/libhugetlbfs/blob/master/HOWTO), the [Huge Pages LWN article](https://lwn.net/Articles/376606), the [Red Hat Performance Tuning Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/performance_tuning_guide/sect-red_hat_enterprise_linux-performance_tuning_guide-memory-configuring-huge-pages)). Here we just present a quick walkthrough. In Linux, one can list the page sizes supported by the system with:
```
$ pagesize --all
4096
2097152
1073741824
```
The default page size used by the kernel is 4KB. To use huge pages, one has to allocate a pool of them. To check which huge page pools are already available, type:
```
$ hugeadm --pool-list
       Size  Minimum  Current  Maximum  Default
   2097152        0        0        0        *       
1073741824        0        0        0        

$ grep Huge /proc/meminfo 
AnonHugePages:         0 kB
HugePages_Total:       0
HugePages_Free:        0
HugePages_Rsvd:        0
HugePages_Surp:        0
Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
```
The `Default` flag means that the currently running system will be using 2MB huge pages. To make it use 1GB huge pages instead, one has to add the following line to the kernel boot command line, and reboot the machine:
```
hugepagesz=1GB default_hugepagesz=1GB
```
To allocate 50 thousand huge pages of 2 MB each at runtime, do the following (as root):
```
$ hugeadm -v --add-temp-swap --pool-pages-min 2MB:50000
hugeadm:INFO: page_size<2MB> adjust<50000> counter<0>
hugeadm:INFO: 1, 50000 -> 50000, 50000
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 10236 KiB
no label, UUID=1014c55a-d37c-46ad-804e-481861124bf6
hugeadm:INFO: setting HUGEPAGES_TOTAL to 50000
hugeadm:INFO: setting HUGEPAGES_OC to 0
```
Then check if allocation succeeded with:
```
$ hugeadm --pool-list
      Size  Minimum  Current  Maximum  Default
   2097152    50000    50000    50000        *
1073741824        0        0        0         
```
Allocation might fail if the memory is highly fragmented (especially when using 1GB pages). This appears as the following message:
```
hugeadm:WARNING: failed to set pool minimum to 100 became 0
```
If this happens, rebooting the machine will solve the problem. One could also fix a specific configuration of huge pages at boot time, by adding the following line to the kernel boot command line:
```
hugepagesz=1GB default_hugepagesz=1GB hugepages=10
```
The last thing that needs to be configured is which group of users can use huge pages. You can set it by typing (as root):
```
hugeadm --set-shm-group=groupID
```
Now every user in `groupID` can run an already-compiled version of the iterator, so that all its `malloc()` calls are automatically backed by huge pages:
```
$ LD_PRELOAD=libhugetlbfs.so HUGETLB_MORECORE=yes iterator
```
If errors like the following appear, huge pages are not backing the program:
```
libhugetlbfs: WARNING: Hugepage size 2097152 unavailable
libhugetlbfs: WARNING: Hugepage size 1073741824 unavailable
```




## Iterator and NUMA

Assume that a compute node has several sockets, each connected to some memory banks, and that the iterator is executed in parallel using a numer of threads equal to the total number of physical cores in the node. Since the iterator accesses the BWT index in a non-local way, every core is likely to access memory that is not directly connected to its own socket, regardless of how the BWT index is distributed among the sockets. If you are planning to use a number of threads that is at most equal to the number of cores in one socket, and if the memory that is directly connected to a socket suffices to contain the index, it is advised to pin the process to one specific socket.

Consider a machine with 2 sockets and 12 physical cores per socket, and assume that we run the count-only variant of the one-string iterator with 12 threrads on a real 22GB DNA text (index size in RAM 6.5 GB). By pinning the threads and memory to a specific socket, the running time becomes **approx. 11% smaller** that the time without pinning. Using 24 threads, however, makes the program faster.

### Pinning the iterator to a socket

Please refer to the [numactl](https://linux.die.net/man/8/numactl) and [numastat man pages](https://linux.die.net/man/8/numastat) for details on NUMA management. Here we just give a quick walkthrough. 

To list the available sockets in the system, type:
```
$ numactl --hardware
available: 2 nodes (0-1)
node 0 cpus: 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22
node 0 size: 130975 MB
node 0 free: 127348 MB
node 1 cpus: 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23
node 1 size: 131072 MB
node 1 free: 127769 MB
node distances:
node   0   1 
  0:  10  21 
  1:  21  10 
```

To pin the process to a specific socket (``node 0``), type:
```
$ numactl --membind=0 --cpunodebind=0 iterator
```

One can use huge pages in a machine with multiple sockets, however huge pages are distributed equally among sockets by default. To list the huge pages currently assigned to each socket, type:
```
$ numastat -cm | egrep 'Node|Huge'
                 Node 0 Node 1 Node 2 Node 3  Total add
AnonHugePages         0      2      0      8     10
HugePages_Total       0      0      0      0      0
HugePages_Free        0      0      0      0      0
HugePages_Surp        0      0      0      0      0
```
To assign 20 huge pages of size 2MB to a specific socket (``node2``) at runtime, do the following (as root):
```
$ echo 20 > /sys/devices/system/node/node2/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
$ numastat -cm | egrep 'Node|Huge'
                 Node 0 Node 1 Node 2 Node 3  Total
AnonHugePages         0      2      0      8     10
HugePages_Total       0      0     20      0     20
HugePages_Free        0      0     20      0     20
HugePages_Surp        0      0      0      0      0
```
